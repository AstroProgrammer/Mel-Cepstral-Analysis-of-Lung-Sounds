# Mel-Cepstral-Analysis-of-Lung-Sounds

The diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary disorders through auscultation relies on the expertise of the clinician to discriminate normal and adventitious lung sounds. This discrimination is purely based on the ability of the human ear to perceive and characterize closely spaced frequency components embedded in the lung sounds.  Hence, the primary step in substituting the clinician with an intelligent system is to replace the human expertise of characterizing the frequency components, present in the lung sounds, with its mathematical model. This code comprises the concept of modelling frequency response of the human auditory perception with Mel-Cepstrum, review on Mel-Cepstrum in lung sound analysis and eventually, the Mel-Cepstral Coefficients extracted from specimen lung sounds are analysed.
